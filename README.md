# Twitter-Manager
Via a menu-driven solution, I created a program that allows a user to run basic tasks on a set of tweet data that
emulates the basic functionality of Twitter. Users should be able to create tweets, display tweets, save tweets to a file, search tweets
based on a keywords, and calculate the number of stop words that are present across all of the tweets.
